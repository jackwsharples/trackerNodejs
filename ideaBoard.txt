Ideas:

Passwords/Accounts, with future plans to get some more people onto the tracker
    - For now create the front end side of things, any user name any password 
    - Later move into specific passwords for users, keep admin/guest for test/demo

Multiple bikes/cars per account 
   - Ability to upload a photo that would be able to save to the bike/car

New format
- Redo Home
    - Small basic discription, name, major, love for bikes, passion project while in school
    - Have the live tracker demo run below, always visable and able to be seen
    - Light Dark mode switch button

- Vehicle main tab
    - List of vehicles, Photo/Name 
    - Clicking into the vehicle leads you to 2 maps, Verticle, 
        - Live ping in top(only shows the most recent ping) 
        - Tracker below it, increase stored pings, Display most recent ride, drop down listing past rides(determined by 10+ mins of stationary)

- Testing Page
    - Move JSON Raw and idea board off the home page, move to the testing page
